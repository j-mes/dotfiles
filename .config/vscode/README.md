# VS Code profile and extensions folder

This folder contains machine-specific VS Code configuration, profiles and extension lists.

Files you can add here:

-   `profiles/` — a folder to store VS Code Profile JSON files
-   `extensions-personal.txt` — newline-separated list of extensions for personal machines
-   `extensions-work.txt` — newline-separated list of extensions for work machines

The `install.sh` script does not automatically install VS Code extensions yet, but this
is a ready place to keep those lists and profile exports.
